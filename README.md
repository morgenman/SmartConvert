# SmartConvert
This script is going to be a quick and easy way to batch convert Smartboard's proprietary notebook files into the far more used .pdf format.
Fortunately, .notebook files are simply zips with svg images in it. 
It would be nice to eventially convert this script possibly to run with applescript or autimator as a program which you would simply 'drop' the files onto to have them convert so teachers with macs can easily share their notes with students.
However, my primary goal at the moment is to create a working script which runs on linux machines for my own personal use.
